## 📧 Contact Form Setup

The contact form sends emails using the Resend API.

### How It Works
1. User fills out the contact form
2. Form validates required fields (name, email, service, message)
3. POST request sent to `/api/send-email`
4. Email formatted with HTML template
5. Sent via Resend to `ceo.fortune@outlook.com`
6. Success animation displayed to user

### Testing Without API Key
The form includes a simulation mode that works without `RESEND_API_KEY`:
- Shows success animation after 2 seconds
- Logs form data to console
- Perfect for development testing

### Production Setup
1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
2. Set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Verify sender domain in Resend dashboard
4. Test form submission on live site

---

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

5. Deploy!

#### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI
